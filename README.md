# Battleship
Battleship (also Battleships or Sea Battle[1]) is a guessing game for two players. It is played on ruled grids (paper or board) on which each players fleet of ships (including battleships) are marked. The locations of the fleets are concealed from the other player. Players alternate turns calling "shots" at the other player's ships, and the objective of the game is to destroy the opposing player's fleet. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game))

# Playing
There are 3 levels in the game - easy, medium and difficult, plus a button that navigates to the last level you played.
There is a record table of each stage.
You can play a game with sensors so that at the beginning of the game this is the main situation that must remain in the same condition otherwise the ships move. Alternatively, you can play without a sensor and there will be a warning.
At the end of the game if you win you will have to supply your name in order for you to stay in the table.
